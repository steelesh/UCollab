# ðŸš€ UCollab Features

##  Overview
This page outlines the current features that UCollab has to offer!

---

## Project Creation
1.  Students can create project posts with the following defined types:
- Project Feedback
- Project Contribution 
- Developer Available
- Seeking Mentor
- Mentor Available
- Team formation

For project-related posts, there's flexibility in their purpose. For example, a Project Feedback post can also indicate that the project is seeking contributors, while a Project Contribution post can simultaneously request feedback on the project. This allows users to address multiple needs with a single post.

2. Each post type will include relevant details, such as basic information (title, description, creation date, author details), engagement features (ratings, comments, bookmarks, trending status), technical specifications (GitHub repository, technology stack, project requirements), and elements for user engagement (comments, ratings, and bookmarking functionality). Most fields are conditional and should only be included if relevant to your specific post type.

## Project Discovery
1. Students can find projects based on filters such as skills, interests, and technologies used, making it easy to connect with others who share similar goals.

## Project Bookmarks
1. Students will be able to bookmark specific projects to receive notifications on progress and discussions, ensuring they stay informed and never miss important updates on projects they are interested in.

## Peer Feedback
1. UCollab provides a built-in comment system for all post types, encouraging students to offer and receive constructive critiques on their work.
2. Rating functionality is exclusively available for Project Feedback posts, and only when enabled by the post owner. This adds an extra layer of evaluation to provide useful feedback.
3. All post types (Project Contribution, Developer Available, Seeking Mentor, Mentor Available, Team Formation) have comments enabled by default, though post owners can disable comments if desired.
4. Users can reply to existing comments and mention other users with the @ symbol to notify them of relevant discussions.

## Mentorship
UCollab facilitates mentorship connections through dedicated post types:

- "Seeking Mentor" - for students who need guidance
- "Mentor Available" - for experienced students offering support

UCollab automatically matches mentors with mentees based on shared technology interests and skills, making it easy to find relevant guidance. Students can seek guidance on complex projects, receive advice on improving their work, and learn from those with more experience in the field.

## Profiles
1. Each user on UCollab will have a customizable profile, showcasing their personal information, academic background, and technical expertise.
2. The profile also displays their latest posts and comments, helping users connect with others who share similar academic and professional goals.

2. Users can customize which notification types they receive through their account settings.
3. The bell icon in the navbar displays unread notifications for quick access.
4. The /notifications route allows users to view all notifications and manage them (delete, mark as read, etc.).
