# ü§ù UCollab User Personas

##  Overview
These are the user personas we came up with as part of our pre-development process for UCollab.

---

### Justin Time 

#### About: 
Justin is a freshman at the University of Cincinnati. He moved to Cincinnati from out of state, so he does not know a lot of people coming out of high school. He‚Äôs majoring in Information Technology with no specified path yet. He lives on campus and has two roommates, but they are in completely different majors from him. None of their classes match up whatsoever. He also finds it a bit hard to communicate with people in person and tends to prefer virtual conversation. 


#### Problem/Solution: 
With Justin‚Äôs classes, he‚Äôs finding that he‚Äôs really struggling with his coding courses. But he can‚Äôt seem to find the courage to really ask anyone in person for help, including the professor. He feels stuck and at a loss. Justin would really benefit from a UC student specific site where you could collaborate.  

 

 

### Polly Noll 

#### About: 
Polly is a junior at the University of Cincinnati. She is a Computer Science major. She does a lot of her classes remotely as she has a full-time job to help pay for her tuition. With this, she doesn‚Äôt get any face-to-face time with really any other students, other than the occasional mandatory presentation. She doesn‚Äôt visit the campus at all. 


#### Problem/Solution: 
Polly is getting farther into her degree which means that classes are getting a bit more involved. Polly has started to struggle a bit. She never found the Canvas community posts to be helpful because no one checks them. She also doesn‚Äôt like bothering Professors as she likes to have answers to her issues quickly. Polly also wishes she could meet more like-minded individuals. There are many projects coming up for her that require team cooperation. Polly would really benefit from a UC student website in which other computer science students and related majors can discuss and socialize.  



### Emily Carter

#### About: 
Emily is a junior majoring in Cybersecurity at the University of Cincinnati. She is passionate about ethical hacking and has completed several online courses, but she lacks hands-on experience in collaborative projects.

#### Problem/Solution: 
Emily wants to build a portfolio of projects to showcase her skills but struggles to find peers who share her interests. UCollab can connect her with fellow cybersecurity students for group projects, allowing them to work together on practical challenges, share resources, and enhance their learning experience.



### Kevin Lawson

#### About: 
Kevin is a graduate student specializing in Game Development and Simulation. He is passionate about creating immersive gaming experiences but struggles to find other developers to collaborate with on projects.

#### Problem/Solution: 
Kevin has an idea for a game but needs artists and programmers to bring it to life. UCollab can help him connect with students across IT and Computer Science disciplines, enabling him to form a diverse team with complementary skills and work collaboratively on his project.
