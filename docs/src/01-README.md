### UCollab

UCollab is a web platform created for University of Cincinnati students pursuing degrees in Information Technology (IT), Computer Science (CS), Information Systems (IS), and other tech related fields. This platform streamlines the creation, discovery, and collaboration on software, app, and code-based projects, while also enabling feedback and constructive discussion between students. UC students can use UCollab to pitch new projects, find collaborators, receive mentorship from senior students or experienced peers, provide or receive feedback on developed work, or simply engage in discussions around project ideas and development.
